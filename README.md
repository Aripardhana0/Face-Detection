# Face-Detection
A Python-based application for detecting human faces using computer vision techniques. This project utilizes OpenCV, a powerful library for computer vision tasks, to identify and draw bounding boxes around faces in images or real-time video streams.

# Features
Face Detection: Detects faces in images and video frames.
Real-time Detection: Provides real-time face detection from webcam feeds.
Bounding Box Visualization: Draws bounding boxes around detected faces for easy identification.

# Installation
System Requirements
Python (3.7 or higher)
OpenCV library
